# ðŸ”§ Vercel Build Fix Summary - SocialBoost

## ðŸ“Š **Issue Resolved: âœ… SUCCESSFUL**

### **ðŸš¨ Original Problem:**
```
Type error: Cannot find module '@shopify/web-pixels-extension' or its corresponding type declarations.
```

**Root Cause:** The web pixel extension was being included in the main Next.js build, causing TypeScript compilation errors because the extension's dependencies are not available in the main app context.

---

## ðŸ”§ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Webpack Configuration**
Added webpack configuration to `next.config.js`:
```javascript
webpack: (config, { isServer }) => {
  // Exclude extensions directory from the main build
  config.resolve.alias = {
    ...config.resolve.alias,
    '@shopify/web-pixels-extension': false,
  };
  
  // Exclude extensions from being processed
  config.module.rules.push({
    test: /extensions\/.*\.ts$/,
    use: 'ignore-loader',
  });
  
  return config;
},
```

### **2. Vercel Ignore File**
Created `.vercelignore` to exclude extensions from Vercel builds:
```
# Exclude extensions from Vercel build
extensions/
extensions/web-pixel/
extensions/web-pixel/node_modules/
extensions/web-pixel/dist/
extensions/web-pixel/.shopify/
```

### **3. Dependencies**
Installed `ignore-loader` package:
```bash
npm install --save-dev ignore-loader
```
