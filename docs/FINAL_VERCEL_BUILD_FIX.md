# ðŸŽ‰ Final Vercel Build Fix - COMPLETE SUCCESS

## ðŸ“Š **Issue Resolution: âœ… SUCCESSFUL**

### **ðŸš¨ Original Problem:**
```
Type error: Cannot find module '@shopify/web-pixels-extension' or its corresponding type declarations.
```

**Root Cause:** The web pixel extension was being included in the main Next.js build, causing TypeScript compilation errors because the extension's dependencies are not available in the main app context.

---

## ðŸ”§ **Final Solution Implemented**

### **1. Simplified Webpack Configuration**
Updated `next.config.js` with a clean, effective approach:
```javascript
webpack: (config, { isServer }) => {
  // Exclude the entire extensions directory from the build
  config.module.rules.push({
    test: /extensions/,
    use: 'ignore-loader',
  });
  
  // Exclude the specific problematic module
  config.resolve.alias = {
    ...config.resolve.alias,
    '@shopify/web-pixels-extension': false,
  };
  
  return config;
},
```

### **2. Vercel Ignore File**
Created `.vercelignore` to exclude extensions from Vercel builds:
```
# Exclude extensions from Vercel build
extensions/
extensions/web-pixel/
extensions/web-pixel/node_modules/
extensions/web-pixel/dist/
extensions/web-pixel/.shopify/
```

### **3. Dependencies**
Installed `ignore-loader` package:
```bash
npm install --save-dev ignore-loader
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Technical Solution Details**

### **What Was Fixed:**
1. **Module Resolution**: Excluded `@shopify/web-pixels-extension` from main build
2. **Directory Exclusion**: Prevented entire extensions directory from being processed
3. **Build Isolation**: Separated extension build from main app build
4. **TypeScript Errors**: Resolved compilation errors for extension-specific modules

### **Build Process:**
1. **Main App**: Builds without extension dependencies
2. **Extensions**: Built separately by Shopify CLI
3. **Deployment**: Both components deploy successfully
4. **Vercel**: Clean build without extension interference
